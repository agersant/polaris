# Changelog

## Polaris 0.15.0

### Server

- Added support for browsing the music collection by metadata (by artist, by genre, etc.).
- Added support for multi-value metadata for the following song fields: `artist`, `album artist`, `composer`, `genre`, `label` and `lyricist`.
- Added support for structured search query syntax.
- Added capability to extract audio waveform data.
- Configuration data (user credentials, music directories, etc.) is now stored in a plain-text file which Polaris can read and write to.
- ⚠️ The configuration format is now ([documented](docs/CONFIGURATION.md)) and slightly simpler than in previous versions.
- Persistent data, such as playlists, is now saved in a directory that may be configured with the `--data` CLI option or the `POLARIS_DATA_DIR` environment variable.
- ⚠️ Upon first launch, configuration data and playlists will be migrated from the Polaris 0.14.0 database into their new homes. After successful migration, the old database file will be deleted and the server will finally start. This migration functionality will be removed in future Polaris versions.
- Collection scans are now automatically triggered when configuration changes or files are added/removed.
- ⚠️ Dynamic DNS now works with any provider that supports updates over HTTP without header-based auth. This means YDNS is no longer an option, and you need to input a new URL for DDNS updates.
- ⚠️ Removed last.fm integration due to maintenance concerns (abandoned libraries, broken account linking) and mismatch with project goals.
- Removed periodic collection scans.

### Web client

- The Recently Added Albums and Random Albums pages now distinguish albums by file metadata instead of file path.
- When navigating back to the Random Albums page, the shuffle ordering is now preserved.

- Documentation is now served under `/api-docs` instead of `/swagger` (eg. `http://localhost:5050/api-docs`)
- Clients are now expected to send their preferred API major version in a `Accept-Version` header. Omitting this currently defaults to `7`, but will become an error in future Polaris releases. Support for API version 7 will be removed entirely in a future release.

- The `/search/<query>` endpoint now supports per-field queries and boolean combinators.
- The `/thumbnail` endpoint supports a new size labeled `tiny`, which returns 40x40px images.
